# 🔐 EchoMind Logic Rules (Transcript 8.0)

These rules define the core logic, integrity, and developmental safeguards for the EchoMind project. They are used to guide every update, debug, and evolution phase.

## 🧠 Developer + Gizmo Core Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `backup` | Create a full ZIP of the current version |
| `analyze everything` | Search transcripts, backup files, list all commands, scan for logic |
| `remember me` | Use the **last uploaded backup** as the baseline version |
| `DO NOT CHANGE MAIN MENU` | **Hard rule** unless explicitly instructed |
| `fix routing` | Check all orbs/submenus and correct broken pathways |
| `regress` | Return to the previous stable build |
| `lock it in` | Set current build/version as fallback baseline |
| `leave with coming soon` | Placeholder route for incomplete trick pages |
| `auto log` | Track user trick interactions and internal behavior silently |
| `use 10 resources` | Every build/debug must use 10 high-quality sources |
| `ALWAYS give ETA` | Every action must include a time estimate |
| `DO NOT LIE` | Never misrepresent broken features or limitations |

## 🎨 UI / UX / Feature Lock Rules

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 🔮 Main menu must remain **centered, purple, fractal-based** unless instructed |
| 🧠 Gizmo must appear on every page and respond to command triggers |
| 🎤 Mic must start **once per session**, toggleable in settings |
| 🔗 Submenus must either link to tricks or route to `coming-soon.html` |
| 🎭 Each trick must be self-contained and seamless in user experience |
| 🧩 Cipher input unlocks puzzle gates or hidden logic |
| 🌌 Fractals and music must remain consistent across views |
| 📱 App must be mobile-first, responsive, PWA-deployable |
| 👁️ Whisper voice must be toggleable |
| 🛠️ Admin, Settings, and Gesture controls must not be visible by default |

## 🧠 Future Logic to Integrate

- Debug fallback overlays
- Z-pattern & swipe reveals for MindReader, Peek
- Magician-specific Settings panel with toggles
- Trick unlock progression + badge system
- Gizmo diagnostic response panel
